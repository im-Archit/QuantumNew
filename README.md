**Multi-disease risk screening using ML-powered diagnostics**  
[🌐 Live Site](https://quantum-new.vercel.app/) • [📂 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/im-Archit/QuantumNew)

## Overview  
QuantumDiagnose is a web platform that allows users to screen themselves for four major chronic diseases — **heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and diabetes** — using machine learning models trained on real clinical datasets.

The tool focuses on accuracy, interpretability, and accessibility, giving users real-time risk guidance based on their report data.

## Features  
- Real-time disease risk evaluation across 4 conditions
- Model accuracies:  
  - Kidney: **100%**  
  - Liver: **98%**  
- Secure login with **Clerk**  
- Payment integration via **Stripe** for advanced access  
- Built-in calibration and fairness checks using ECE and subgroup metrics  
- Designed for multilingual, mobile-friendly access

## Tech Stack  
**Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion  
**Backend**: Streamlit (ML models), Vercel (deployment)  
**Other Tools**: Clerk (Auth), Stripe (Payments), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Status  
✅ Fully functional frontend and ML integration  
🧪 Validated on real-world datasets with strong cross-validation performance  
📍 Used by ~20 test users during development

## How It Works  
1. Users log in securely using Clerk  
2. Enter basic health metrics from lab reports  
3. Models assess the risk of each disease  
4. Results and risk zones are presented in real-time
